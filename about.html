            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The concept of a portfolio has evolved over time, and its origins can be traced back to various fields. <br>
                Here's a brief history of how the portfolio has developed in different contexts: <br>
            
            <i>Art and Design:</i><br>
            In the art world, portfolios have been used for centuries to showcase an artist's best works. <br>
            Artists would compile their paintings, sketches, and sculptures into a physical portfolio to present to patrons or potential employers. <br>
            This practice dates back to the Renaissance when artists sought to demonstrate their skills and secure commissions. <br>
        
            <i>Finance:</i><br>
            The term "portfolio" in finance has its roots in the 20th century. <br>
            In 1952, economist Harry Markowitz introduced Modern Portfolio Theory, which emphasized the importance of diversification to reduce risk in investment. <br>
            This theory laid the foundation for the concept of a financial portfolio, a collection of different assets with varying levels of risk and return. <br>
        
            <i>Writing and Literature:</i><br>
            Writers have long created portfolios, though they were not always called as such. <br>
            In academia, a writer's portfolio often includes a collection of their best essays, research papers, and creative works. <br>
            As technology advanced, writers transitioned from physical portfolios to digital ones, sharing their work online or in electronic formats. <br>
            
            <i>Technology and Web Development:</i><br>
            With the rise of the internet and the need for showcasing digital skills, web developers and designers started creating online portfolios. <br>
            These portfolios became a crucial tool for professionals to display their coding abilities, project management skills, and the aesthetics of their designs. Code repositories, such as GitHub, also serve as a form of a portfolio for developers. <br>
            
            <i>Education:</i><br>
            In education, the concept of a portfolio has gained prominence as a tool for assessing student learning. <br>
            The use of student portfolios has expanded beyond showcasing academic achievements to include reflections, goals, and evidence of personal and academic growth. <br>
        
            <i>Job Seekers:</i><br> 
            The use of portfolios in job seeking has become increasingly common. While resumes remain essential, <br>
            job seekers often supplement them with portfolios that showcase their skills, accomplishments, and work samples. <br>
            This trend is particularly prevalent in creative fields, tech industries, and positions that require a demonstrable track record. <br>
            
            <i>Photography:</i><br>
            In photography, physical portfolios were historically used to display prints and demonstrate a photographer's style. <br>
            However, the shift to digital platforms has led photographers to create online portfolios, making it easier to reach a broader audience and showcase their work to potential clients. <br>
             <br>
             The history of portfolios reflects a shift from physical, tangible collections to digital and online formats. 
             <br>Whether in art, finance, writing, or technology, portfolios have become integral tools for individuals to showcase their skills, experiences, and achievements. <br>
             The evolution of portfolios continues to adapt to the changing needs and technologies of each field.
